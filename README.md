## About
Built in Java, the _Tree Search + Pathfinding_ project implements some of the basic search methods used for problem solving in artificial intelligence, and to see the benefits of heuristic search. In this project, we experiment with a basic formulation of the general pathfinding problem. 

_Tree Search + Pathfinding_ is a midterm project by Matthew Montoya & Hiram Rios for UTEP's Artificial Intelligence, CS 4320.

## How To Compile/Run
1. Open the directory to **/ai-tree-searches/test_case_file files/**
2. Execute jar file by typing in: **java -jar AIHW2Lab.jar test_case_size_size.txt BFS**

Alternatively, the _.java_ files may be imported into your IDE and run locally

## Dependancies
1. Java 8 or later
2. Microsoft Windows 7 or later or macOS High Sierra or later
